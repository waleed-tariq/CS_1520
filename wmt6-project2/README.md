# CS/COE 1520 Project 2

## Goal:
To gain experience using Flask and building data models via an ORM by
developing a website to help manage a catering company.

## High-level description:
You will be writing a website to help manage a catering company.  To accomplish
this, you will need to consider three classes of users: the owner of the
company, company staff, and registered customers.  Customers will request
events on given days (or cancel events they had previously requested), staff
will sign up to work events, and the owner will given a rundown of what events
are scheduled and who is working each event.  The company cannot schedule more
than 1 event per day, and each event needs only 3 Staff members to run.

## Specifications:
1. You must build your website using Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, and the
  Flask-SQLAlchemy extension.

1. Managing users
	* Each user (Owner, Staff, or Customer) should have a username and
	  password.
	* Customers are free to register for their own account.
	* Staff accounts must be created by the Owner (it is fine for the Owner
	  to set passwords for the Staff).
	* If a user is logged in, no matter what page they are on, they should
	  have access to a logout link.

1. Owner
	* Should be able to login with the username `owner` and password `pass`.
	* Once logged in, the Owner should be presented with a link to create new
	  staff accounts, and a list of all scheduled events.
		* For each event, the Staff members signed up to work that event should
		  be listed.
		* If no events are scheduled, a message should be displayed informing
		  the Owner of this explicitly.
		* If any scheduled event has no staff signed up to work, a message
		  should be displayed informing the Owner of this explicitly.

1. Staff
	* Once logged in, Staff members should be presented with a list of events
	  they are scheduled to work and a list of events that they can sign up to
	  work.
		* For each event that a Staff member can sign up to work, they should
		  be provided a link to sign up for that event.
		* No event that already has 3 Staff members signed up to work should be
		  presented as a sign up option for other Staff members.

1. Customers
	* Once logged in, Customers should be presented with a form to request a
	  new event, and a list of events they have already requested.
		* If a Customer requests an event on a date when another event is
		  already scheduled, they should be presented with an message saying
		  that the company is already booked for that date.
		* For each requested event, the Customer should be provided with a link
		  to cancel that event.

1. Data management
	* To ease bootstrapping and testing of your application, hardcode the
	  Owner's username and password in your app to be `owner` and `pass`.
	* All other data for your application should be stored in an SQLite
	  database named `catering.db` using SQLAlchemy's ORM and the
	  Flask-SQLAlchemy extension.

1. Setup
	* You must setup and run Flask within a virtual environment. A
	  `requirements.txt` file has been added to the repository for you to use
	  in setting up your virtual environment. This is the same environment
	  your TA will use to test your project. *Do not* add your virtual
	  environment folder to your repository.

## Submission Guidelines:
* **DO NOT SUBMIT** any IDE package files.

* Do not include `catering.db` in your submitted repository.

* You must name the main flask file for your site `catering.py`, and place it
  in the root directory of your repository.

* You must be able to run your application by setting the `FLASK_APP`
  environment variable to your `catering.py` and running `flask run`

* You must be able to initialize your database by setting the `FLASK_APP`
  environment variable to your `catering.py` and running `flask initdb`

* You must fill out `info_sheet.txt`.

* Be sure to remember to push the latest copy of your code back to your
  GitHub repository before the the assignment is due.  At the deadline, the
  repositories will automatically be copied for grading.  Whatever is present
  in the `main` branch of your GitHub repository at that time will be
  considered your submission for this assignment.

## Additional Notes/Hints:
* You may find it handy to use the HTML `date` input type for event
  scheduling.

* While you are not going to be heavily graded on the style and design of your
  web site, it should be presented in a clear and readable manner.

* Your project submissions will be tested using a recent version of Google
  Chrome.
